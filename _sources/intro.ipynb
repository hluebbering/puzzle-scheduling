    "`Hoefnagel` Wooden Jigsaw Puzzle Club is a company based in Port Townsend, Washington that contains a library of over 1000 **puzzles** rented by a network of puzzle enthusiasts worldwide. Their ultimate business goal is to reduce shipping costs while optimizing for consumer satisfaction. Right now, when an active member of the club finishes a puzzle, they start a return process on the site, which generates a shipping label for the user to ship this puzzle to the next user's location in the overall puzzle network. This next location is determined by a model that considers several factors, such as the puzzle's current location, the next user's location, and the puzzle's rank on the next user's wishlist. \n",
